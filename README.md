# Investigation of Violent Crime Rates per Capita

## Overview

This repository contains two major investigations related to violent crime rates per capita:

1. **Dimension Reduction and Handwriting Analysis**
2. **Linear Model Investigation and Derivation**

Each subfolder contains its own code, documentation, and results, with a dedicated README for more details.
